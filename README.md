## Getting Started
1. First, navigate to the [Day Planner Application](https://day-planner-sb.herokuapp.com/today) and log in. 

2. On the Today page, you will see your active goals and action items for today. If you don't have any goals, click the Goals header or Goals from the dropdown menu to create one!

3. Create some tasks to go with your Goals by clicking Tasks on the dropdown menu from the header. You can set due dates, and select the relevant goal. 

4. Create habits! Name your habit and add details. Select the _days applicable_ to determine when the habit should show up on your Today page. Set a _weekly target_ to track your progress. An example: I want to exercise 5 days a week. It doesn't matter what day I complete the exercise, so I can check the boxes for Sun-Sat. However, I don't have to exercise every single day to be successful, so I set the Weekly Target at 5. 

   _Note: for the purpose of displaying the application's functionality, creating a habit currently create's artificial historical data for this habit. Click on the name of the habit to check it out!_

5. Navigate to the Goals page to see all goals, and click on the name of a specific goal to see all tasks and habits associated with that goal. 

6. Visit the Today page by clicking the calendar icon to see your action items! You can check off tasks and habits and add Journal entries. Navigate to different views by clicking on the navigation bar drop down, the section headers, or the individual line items.
